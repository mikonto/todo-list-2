When loading the app:
- Inbox is open by default

- Check if localStorage exists
-- If yes, load existing tasks of inbox & projects
-- If no, show empty inbox

Actions that can be done from the main view:

Menu:
- Open inbox
-- Shows tasks of the default project (= Inbox)

- Open Today
-- Shows all the task that have due date today

- Open This week
-- Shows all the task that have due date this week

- Open projects
-- Shows tasks of other projects (if exists)

- Add Project
-- Opens a window for adding a new project. Input: name

- Delete projects
-- Deletes project (non default project)

Main section:
- Add Task
-- Opens a window for adding new task. Inputs: title, description, due date, priority

- Complete task
-- When clicking task, it will be completed & disappears from the list
-- Completion time will be added into task

- Delete/edit tasks
-- Delete removes the task
-- Edit opens window for editing the task

Ideas:
Make a class that adds all the instances into an array. Then loop over the array when opening lists.
